# BUSAN201SQLAssignment
BUSAN 201 Semester 1 2023 SQL Assignment

The intention of setting this assignment is for you to partially obtain learning outcome 5 of this course. The process of attempting the assignment is more valuable than the mark received for the completion of the assignment.

In attempting and completing this assignment correctly, it is intended you will improve your:

• Data-based problem solving skills.

o The answers to most of the questions will likely require you to tackle the problem bit-by-bit
(a form of abstraction or “divide and conquer” problem solving).

o Some questions require you to explore the dataset’s metadata and to understand what the
data involved looks like.

o Trial and error is not an effective way to solve data problems. Make use of techniques that
will save you time and progress toward a solution, e.g. reading the database diagram.


• Ability to manipulate relational data using SQL SELECT statements.

o The answers require you to know when and how to correctly use scalar functions, WHERE
clauses, JOINs, aggregate functions, HAVING clauses, CASE statements and subqueries.
